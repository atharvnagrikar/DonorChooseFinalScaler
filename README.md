# DonorChooseFinalScaler
The study aims to enhance project selection on DonorsChoose.org using a predictive model. By analyzing project descriptions, metadata, and teacher/school information, it predicts approval outcomes, improving efficiency through intelligent machine learning.

# Data Preprocessing
The data processing phase, including exploratory data analysis (EDA), has been successfully completed and is showcased in the Jupyter notebook.

# Machine Learning model Training
The Jupyter notebook showcases the training of Random Forest, XGBoost, and Naive Bayes models. Additionally, accompanying scripts have been provided for reference.

# GUI Development
Gradio is utilized to create a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI). One notable advantage of Gradio is its ability to keep the application live for 72 hours by generating a public link.
